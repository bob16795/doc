# Imagery

She's as quiet as the night.

Everyone is mad at her.

Her mistakes are tearing her apart.

Her lips are red from blood.

she could taste blood from her lips.

her parent's relationship is unkempt.

she daydreamed about smell.

Her mistakes are tearing her apart.

she could taste blood from her lips.
