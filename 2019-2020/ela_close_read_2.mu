## close read act 2

1- I would characterize Elizabeth as a little bland and in the need to be spiced up
2- When Procter passed Elizabeth he paused, because he feels guilty.
3- The mood is gloomy because heâ€™s not happy after the end of the day of work and seeing her.
4- Does Elizabeth know he cheated on her
